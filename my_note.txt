mySQL is like managed database service
SQL is more like a language
Database is collections of data 


1, Install mySQL
	window10:
	-click installation file	
		-change Charactor Set utf8 (tick third box first)
		-port: 3306

2, Delete mySQL

	-click installation file, then press remove
	-delete directory C:\ProgramData\MySQL
	-delete directory C:\Program Files(86)\MySQL

3, Make sure mySQL is running by checking services.msi

4, login to mySQL from terminal
	-command:  mysql -uroot -p

5, Normal commands;
	-show databases;  ( ; must have)
	-use filename;  (which database)
	-create database my_first_database ( new database)

6, DQL: select ( means find )
   DML: data in table
   	insert   ( means add)
	delete   ( means delete)
	update   ( means modify)
   DDL: the structure of table
   	create   ( means new )
	drop     ( means delete)
	alter    ( means modify)
   TCL: upload 
   	commit   ( means upload)
	rollback ( means pull back)
   DCL: who is in control
   	grant    ( authorize)
	revoke   ( take away Auth)

7, Have a look at all info at table
	select * from table_name
   Have a look at the structure of table
   	desc table_name

8, Check version of mySQL
	select version();
   		
9, Check which database
	select database();

10, Alias in table
	select column as 'new name' from table_name;   ( 'string' reckon )
	select column, another from table_name;
	select column, num*12 from table_name;   ( yes, can do math)

11, Condition
	select column from table_name where salary=1000;
	select e_name, e_number from table_name where e_name='SMITH';
	select ename, sal from table_name where  column is/is not null;   # dont use '=', must use is or is not;
	and is equenlante to &&
	or id equvalante to ||
	priority order: and is higher than or, but ( ) is more higher.
	in( number1, number2, number3), means exactly match those three number,not from XX to XX,
	between XX and XX is field.
	column like '%XXX_XX' means % is any charactors, _ is a charactor.
