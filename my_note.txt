mySQL is like managed database service
SQL is more like a language
Database is collections of data

	-click installation file, then press remove
	-delete directory C:\ProgramData\MySQL
	-delete directory C:\Program Files(86)\MySQL

3, Make sure mySQL is running by checking services.msi

4, login to mySQL from terminal
	-command:  mysql -uroot -p

5, Normal commands;
	-show databases;  ( ; must have)
